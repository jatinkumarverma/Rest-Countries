## Features

### 1. View All Countries

On the homepage of the app, you will find a list of all countries retrieved from the REST Countries API. Each country is represented by a card displaying its name, flag, population, region, and capital.

### 2. Search for a Country

The app provides a convenient `input` field that allows you to search for a specific country. As you type, the list of countries will dynamically update to display only those that match your search query.

### 3. Filter by Region

You can also filter countries by region using the region selection dropdown. This helps you narrow down your exploration to countries belonging to a particular geographic region.

### 4. Detailed Information

Clicking on a country's card will take you to a separate page that displays more detailed information about the selected country. This includes data such as population, area, languages spoken, currencies used, and more.

### 5. Bordering Countries

While viewing detailed information about a specific country, you will find a list of its bordering countries. Clicking on any of these border countries will take you to their detailed information page, allowing you to seamlessly navigate between countries.

### 6. Color Scheme Toggle (Optional)

For your viewing comfort, the app provides an optional feature to toggle between light and dark modes. This can be particularly useful when using the app in different lighting environments.
